## About

The VisGuides 2022 Workshop focuses on the analysis, design, reflection, and discussion of applicable frameworks to mastering guidelines in visualization by the broader visualization community, embedded in a larger research agenda of visualization theory and practices.

This workshop follows-up the ideas from the IEEE VIS 2016, [2018](https://c4pgv.dbvis.de/), and [2020](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/c4pgv/) Workshop on Creation, Curation, Critique and Conditioning of Principles and Guidelines in Visualization (C4PGV).

We propose the VisGuides workshop as a forum to foster constructive discussions around guidelines in visualization and how the academic VIS community disseminates and discusses its findings. Their understanding and operationalization are important not only for academics, but also for practitioners alike, who are tasked to make design trade-offs, problem-solving, and justify decisions. Moreover, guidelines are essential for teaching and learning about visualization. Questions this workshop wants to address include:

- What visualization guidelines exist and how do we (as a scientific community) collect and disseminate them? 

- How do we apply and discuss guidelines in daily-work practice, in design, in advising, and in teaching? 

- What is the role of visualization knowledge and guidelines in the wild, i.e., outside the scientific community? 

- How to scrutinize empirical knowledge and make a discussion around guidelines public?  

- What are types of guidelines, guidance, and how do we formalize visualization knowledge? 

This workshop also features an open call for being part of the program committee (PC) to provide an opportunity to advocate for guidelines in a broad range of topics. If you would like to get involved, contact bbach@ed.ac.uk.

The workshop will be held in a hybrid format. You can attend online or in person though we hope that  you can join us in-person. Online sessions will be synchronous with the in-person workshop.
